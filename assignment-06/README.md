1. I have mostly come across "subscribe to our email" list forms, or pop-up forms on news sites when you won't pay for a subscription. So, for example, the Missoulian has a pop up that asks personal questions to gather data if you don't have a subscription. Thats the form I encounter the most often.
2. A image button input is used on my intro to film editing media arts class! We have a fun picture with a letter inside of it indicating a different section for class (P=project, D=Discussion). It looks like an image but its actually a button that takes you to the next page! An example of a text form is when you input your username and password to enter a site (like Facebook). A selection input example would be when filling out a form and opting in to disclose your race and you choose from a selection.
3. This week was fun! I chose Clyde Coffee because I love their coffee and their avocado toast. I knew immediately that I wanted to do a form in homage of their delicious toast!

Unfortunately, choosing them led to some complications, like the fact that I couldn't find contact email anywhere (I used my own as a placeholder) and their website was the bare minimum.

Also for the table, I chose to break it down by when they open vs. when they closed, as I found it was super cluttered when I put them both on the same line. This is out of the norm, but I thought it was fun to switch it up!

I had some issues resizing my "submit" button. It took me a few tries to learn how to do it. Before I changed the size, it was huge and took up half the page.
