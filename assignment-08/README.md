1. The setup of the pages was fun and i was used to that, but making several pages was a bit daunting! Also setting up the background and messing with the stylesheet was a little tricky. But I was excited to learn!

2. I am so excited to learn about how to beautify sites! But i'd love to learn more about the creation process that happens BEFORE its coded - do people just make it up on the fly? or do they built it/draw it before they code it? I'd love to know more about the history and process.

3. My work cycle started by picking out what I wanted to teach (making coffee) and then consisted of me messing up about 1000X. I did my best to pull images from free stock photo websites, as I don't actually own an espresso machine. I then followed the steps in the lesson, but I kept accidentally messing up the different containers. I also had issues making my pictures not warped!
