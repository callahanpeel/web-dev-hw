1. My imaginary client is a blogger whose topic is Missoula, Montana! They told me they wanted something utilitarian and not too fancy.

2. A block has whitespace above and below it and doesn't allow things next to it. An inline-block is a block adjacent to other content, that behaves like a block.

3. My work cycle for this project was much lengthier than others! I ran into some major confusions when creating my interactive header. I kept forgetting which thing was which (probably due to my shoddy organization), so I kept mixing parts up and slowing myself down! Note to self in future: NAME YOUR CSS. You will save time! :) I also wanted a prettier contact form, so I located some code online. I found some really cool ones for wordpress itself but, unfortunately, we aren't using wordpress so I couldn't use it and had no idea how to move it over!
