1. The id is a unique identifier for an element. The class attribute is kind of like an id, in that its a distinguisher, but rather than giving it a unique identifier, class attribute groups like elements together. Divs are used for grouping different elements of the page together - they create the structure! The span element is similar to a div element, except instead of existing as a standalone, a span is a grouping element that lives WITHIN a div.

2. Alt text is a description of a visual web element. This element is for the visually impaired who use screen readers.

3. My work cycle consisted of messing up a lot, figuring it out and then going back in and fixing minute pieces of code. I started by gathering all of the different elements of media I needed for my webpage. Then I started to build out the different elements of my webpage in atom. I was going along pretty easily until it got to putting in the map element. For some reason, I didn't think to embed a link to the map...instead I put in the address using an address text element. But then I checked out some other people's assignments and realized that we're supposed to embed the actual google maps. Thank goodness for open forums!
