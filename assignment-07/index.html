                <pre>
                  [Verse 1: Drew Holcomb]
                  I left my dear trying to find adventure
                  She spent years trading my whiskey out for seltzer
                  Still I hear her voice in the pit of my failure
                  I ride alone down Goodbye Road

                  I kept my eyes trying to find better weather
                  Just to find it ain't getting any better
                  And still I hear her voice so clear and so tender
                  It's my tale to tell down Goodbye Road

                  [Chorus: Drew Holcomb]
                  Strangers, outcasts, artists and thieves
                  Misfits, legends and lost refugees
                  We may not be where we thought we would be
                  We made our home down Goodbye Road

                  [Verse 2: Ellie Holcomb]
                  You said you were my queen
                  Now you're just an old disaster
                  I said sticks and stones shouldn't be thrown from the pulpit pastor
                  And when I hear that voice I try to move a bit faster
                  I'd rather walk alone down Goodbye Road

                  [Chorus: Ellie Holcomb]
                  Strangers, outcasts, artists and thieves
                  Misfits, legends and lost refugees
                  We may not be where we thought we would be
                  We made our home down Goodbye Road

                  [Bridge: Johnnyswim]
                  Travelin' Paul on the road to Damascus
                  The ghost of Saul, he laid down in a casket
                  Sometimes flowers grow in the soil of ashes
                  Pick 'em as you go down Goodbye Road

                  [Chorus]
                  Strangers, outcasts, artists and thieves
                  Misfits, legends and lost refugees
                  We may not be where we thought we would be
                  Go raid our home down Goodbye Road

                  [Outro]
                  Sometimes flowers grow in the soil of ashes
                  Pick 'em as you go down Goodbye Road
                  We made our home down Goodbye Road
                </pre>
