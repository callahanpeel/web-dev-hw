You can have six headings, but I think you can have an unlimited amount of body elements. I wouldn't advise that though, because eventually your page would be really slow and wouldn't do well SEO-wise.

Structural markups create the structure of the document, so how it is arranged. Examples include the headings of your page, the type of paragraph, how lists are coded, etc. Semantic markups are used to indicate the meaning of different pieces within the document. For example, if I am citing something, I should put <cite> BLAH </cite>, because that indicates its a citation. This is in contrast to when typing into a word document, when you simply need to put the citation in italics. While the end result is the same, the semantics are missed if you don't use proper HTML.

My work experience: this assignment was more challenging than the last few, but more fun! I enjoyed creating the different elements of the page and I can't wait until we move on to CSS. As for my personal choices, I chose to make the title H1 because it demanded the most attention. But then, instead of making each title of the three sub-heads H2, I made them H3 because I wanted the photo and recipe title to be the star of the show. I also wasn't sure where to include my citation, so I decided to just come clean about my lack of originality in the photo caption. I ALSO think its super important to give your image a good alt text title for those who use assisted readers due to visual impairments.
