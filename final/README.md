1. Yes! I knew absolutely nothing (other than a tiny bit of coding) before this class. I knew what a style sheet was and I knew HTML existed, but didn't know anything about how to make it actually work.

2. I didn't know that some fonts weren't websafe and didn't load on all browsers! That was good to know. I'll keep that in mind for the future.

3. I based this off of my website for last week, but I tweaked it to be similar to the personal website I have on squarespace. I'm not sure how to make all the elements of my squarespace page real in wordpress, but I really like my branding. I use a vintage-ish throwback pink and green color scheme. It's really fun for me! Also, this week was easier than last week because I felt like I understood the structure of my code, so it was much quicker to edit and replicate.
