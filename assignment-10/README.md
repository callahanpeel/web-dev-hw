1. I chose a serif for the title stuff and a sans-serif for the body. I picked these because they were understated and refined, just like my story. Because the story is very serious in nature, I didn't want to divert into a fun font, weary that I would disrespect the subject matter.

2. A system font is a font used by an operating system. A web font is a special type of font created just for web use in CSS. Web-safe fonts are fonts that many operating systems already have installed. Fallback fonts are important in case your fonts aren't web-friendly. Then the system knows a pretty font to fallback on, so that you don't have ugly fonts on your site. 

3. Work cycle was good! I just picked out a story, some fonts and then plugged it all in. To be honest, I didn't spend a ton of time making the site itself fancy, as that's where I tend to screw up!
