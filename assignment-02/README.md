I decided to take this class to grow my web knowledge. As a (hopefully, someday) future creative director, its important to understand the structure of web design. I also find web development fascinating and know little to nothing about it, despite its importance in today's world.

I hope to learn the basics of coding, how to build a barebones website and gain a deeper understanding of how computers and servers talk to eachother.
