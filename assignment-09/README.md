1. The universal selector allows html to be styled. The element selector selects like elements that are a certain kind. The class selectors selects elements that are all the same function.

2. My color scheme is brown, brown and more brown. I was trying to get at the grunginess of the 90s, because it permeated everything. The colors were custom made by different individuals, so I used their names for them, along with the hex codes. They are:
Break the Rules
flashes light by amdillon
b u l a e by annapashmina

3. This assignment was a ton of fun! I went with the nineties because I wanted to see what a very brown website looked like. Typically, people don't choose brown because its not a very desirable color. I went with a background image, which I think might have overcomplicated things.
