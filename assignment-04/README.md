1. I visited the old NYTimes page. It looks very different. The style of the title is the exact same, but the webpage is much busier. There is also some random yellow blocks and the overall choice of font is different than it is now. Images are much lower quality and the "Markets" is included on the front page.
2. My Github desktop was already setup? It was weird because I didn't even have to login. And I already had my "web-dev-hw" folder setup, but nothing was in it. So I ended up having to delete the entire thing and restart from scratch.
