The web is different than the Internet because the Internet is a set of rules that allows networks to communicate. On the other hand, the world wide web is a system of different pages that uses the Internet as a sort of highway to pass along.
The Internet is a wire, with servers that are connected directly to the Internet wire. Each server has a unique IP address that different computers use to find each other. Our personal computers/phones at home are indirectly connected to the Internet via an internet service provider.
A directory is a location where files are stored on a computer. The directory is the overarching file that then contains many child folders and files within it.
You can track changes, revert back to the original files, and also share and collaborate files. I think it will be particularly helpful when learning to code because I can see my changes and revert back after making an error if needed. If we weren't using a system like this, I think I would get lost very easily.
This is dorky but I didn't know how to properly name and structure my files. I thought the process of naming, always being consistent and avoiding extraneous characters was quite interesting. Its so easy to understand! I look forward to having an organized file structure in the future.
